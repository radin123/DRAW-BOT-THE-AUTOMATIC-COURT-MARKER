# DRAW-BOT-THE-AUTOMATIC-COURT-MARKER
DRAW BOT – THE AUTOMATIC COURT MARKER         We came up with our project idea to solve a problem with marking courts. Draw-bot is being positioned as the first automatic robot for line marking sport fields we have seen manual court markers that take lot of time to draw a court. The existing mechanism takes a lot of human effort and energy. To solve this problem, we came up with our project “Automatic court marker”. Line marking is currently a pain we’ve all enjoyed a great game of soccer with friends and family, but without the white lines on the pitch, there would be no game at all! Line marking of sports facilities is a manual, time-consuming and resource intensive task. Grounds men, track managers, volunteers and municipalities often do the task. We’ve invented and developed, Draw-Bot which is the s first robot for doing line marking on sports complexes autonomously. This means that we eliminate the need for an operator while getting a much more precise and sustainable result. We are proud to say that the Draw-Bot is able to mark multiple field types.
